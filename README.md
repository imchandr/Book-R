we will be building a book review website named Bookr.
It will allow you to add fields for
publishers, contributors, books, and reviews.
A publisher will publish one or more books, and each book will have one or
more contributors (author, editor, co-author, and so on).
Only admin users will be allowed to modify these fields.
Once a user has signed up for an account on the site, they will be able to start adding reviews to a book.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For our reviews application, 

we need to create the following models and their database tables consequently:

Book: This should store information about books.
Contributor: This should store information about the person(s) who contributed to writing the book, such as author, co-author, or editor.
Publisher: As the name implies, this refers to the book publisher.
Review: This should store all the books' reviews written by the users of theÂ application.
